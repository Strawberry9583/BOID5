I am the Autofolio to recommend algorithms for my graph instances for optimizing treewidth. But after training by giving performance and feature tables to Autofolio, I just obtain an unconvincing model that always recommends the same algorithms even for different instances from the training set. Here is my repository including the training program, performance table (Minimization with the transformed objective function: 1/(1+imporoved_tree_width) ) and feature table
